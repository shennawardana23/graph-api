# README

This sample application is part of the [Full Cycle Go Expert course](https://fullcycle.com.br/). It was started by using the
[gqlgen package](https://gqlgen.com/) for the initial code generation of the GraphQL
handlers and resolvers. Afterwards, the project was evolved by specific implementation
of code logic and the modification of the `schema.graphqls` file, along with the use of the
`go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate` command.
